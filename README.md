# Authentication Service
## About This Project
The authentication service lets user sign up and sign in. 
The user details are stored in a database and after every sign-in a JWT token is created which is used by other services to validate the user and provide features only to validated user. 
The authentication service also handles user data and changing password. There are multiple REST endpoints to handle these features.
## Technologies Used
Java, Spring REST, Spring Security and MySQL database.
